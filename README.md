# IMAGE ENHANCEMENT FRAMEWORK
## DEEP LEARNING ASSISTED SEQUENTIAL IMAGE PROCESSING PIPELINE

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Image Enhancement Framework is a research-oriented image processing system that combines sequential enhancement techniques with deep learning refinement to improve image quality, clarity, and structural detail.

The framework integrates classical image processing methods with neural network–based adaptive refinement to produce visually enhanced outputs. The project is implemented using Google Colab for easy reproducibility and experimentation.

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Raw images often suffer from:

- Low contrast  
- Noise artifacts  
- Poor edge visibility  
- Uneven illumination  

This framework addresses these challenges using a multi-stage enhancement pipeline that progressively improves image quality.
